Creating a simple Tic Tac Toe game


Here in this game I've created a simple TIC TAC TOE game interface while practicing DOM( Document  Object Model) 


About this game and how it works:
1. Here in this game , 2 players should be able to play the together in one screen .
2. A board should be printed with X or O at every move of the player .
3. If its a single tap then the player goes for X and if its a double tap then its a O.
4. According to the number of taps the inputs are taken and the WINNER is declared . 
5. If you want to start again then need to click on RESTART button.
